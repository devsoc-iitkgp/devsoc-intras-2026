## 1. The Problem: "Trust, but Verify"

Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate when dealing with niche, institutional knowledge. They generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect information because they lack real-time access to specific local data.



### The Challenge
Your task is to build a chatbot that answers questions **strictly** using data you scrape from **MetaKGP / MetaWiki**.

**Why this is hard:**
1.  **No Pre-made Dataset:** You must build the pipeline to scrape, clean, and index the data yourself.
2.  **Stale Data Risks:** LLMs have outdated internal knowledge about IIT Kharagpur; you must force them to use *your* scraped data.
3.  **Hallucination:** If the scraper misses a page, the LLM might make something up. Your verification system must prevent this.

## 2. Technical Pillars

### 👥 Team Constraint
* **Team Size:** Strictly **4 Members** per team.

### 🛠 Core Requirements
Your solution **must** integrate these three techniques:

#### 🟢 1. Data Pipeline (Scraping & Indexing)
* **Scraper:** You must write a script to crawl `wiki.metakgp.org` (and related MetaWiki pages).
* **Ingestion:** Clean the HTML/Wikitext and chunk it for retrieval (RAG).
* **Constraint:** **NO external datasets** allowed. If the answer isn't on MetaKGP, the bot should say "I don't know."

#### 🔵 2. Graph of Thoughts (GoT)
Model reasoning as a directed graph.
* **Nodes:** Facts extracted from your scraped documents.
* **Edges:** Logical connections between different wiki pages.
* **Goal:** Connect disparate pieces of info (e.g., connect a *Society* page to a *Student* page).

#### 🟣 3. Mixture of Experts (MoE) Verification
Implement specific verifiers that check against your scraped data:
1.  **Source Matcher:** "Does the text in the retrieved chunk actually support this claim?"
2.  **Hallucination Hunter:** "Is the bot inventing details not present in the scraped context?"
3.  **Logic Expert:** "Does the conclusion follow from the premises?"

## 3. Expected System Behavior

### Example Query
**User:** *"Who are the governors of the Technology Literary Society?"*

**System Output:**
* **Step 1 (Scrape/Retrieve):** System searches vector store for "Technology Literary Society governors".
* **Step 2 (Reasoning Paths):**
    * *Path A:* Claims "John Doe" (Based on 2018 data). -> **Context Expert:** ⚠️ Outdated.
    * *Path B:* Claims "Jane Smith" (Based on hallucination). -> **Source Matcher:** ❌ Citation missing.
    * *Path C:* Claims "Current Governors listed in 2025 section". -> **Source Matcher:** ✅ Verified.
* **Step 3 (Final Answer):** "The current governors are... [List]. (Source: MetaKGP/TLS_Page)"

## 4. Rules & Constraints

### 🔒 Data Source Rules (Strict)
1.  **Allowed Source:** ONLY `wiki.metakgp.org` (and associated MetaWiki domains).
2.  **Forbidden:** Wikipedia, Google Search API, or pre-trained knowledge usage.
3.  **Scraping:** You must implement the scraping logic. Using a pre-downloaded dump is **not allowed**—your code must show how data is fetched.

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
* **Open Source Only:** (LangChain, Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, etc.)
* **API Limits:** Stay within provided free tier limits ($50/team).
